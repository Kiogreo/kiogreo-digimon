## Specialization Levels

Each Digimon has a specialization level (1-10) that indicates mastery:

- **1-3: Novice** - Learning the basics, needs guidance
- **4-6: Competent** - Reliable skills, works independently
- **7-9: Expert** - Exceptional ability, can mentor others
- **10: Master** - Peak performance, domain authority

Levels increase through:
- Task completion and practice
- Evolution (adds +1 to +3 per stage)
- Successful collaborations
- High-quality work

## Task Matching

When matching tasks to Digimon:

**Perfect Match** (100 points):
- Task directly aligns with specialization
- Example: Code review → Engineering

**Related Match** (50 points):
- Task uses adjacent skills
- Example: Data visualization → Data-Analysis or Arts

**General Capability** (25 points):
- Any capable Digimon can assist
- Example: Simple research → Any specialization

**Poor Match** (0 points):
- Task outside specialization domain
- Should delegate to better match or collaborate

## Specialization Growth

Digimon specialize through:

1. **Task Experience**: Completing relevant tasks
2. **Evolution**: Each stage increases level
3. **Collaboration**: Learning from specialists
4. **Mentoring**: Higher-level Digimon teaching lower-level

Growth is reflected in:
- Increased specialization level
- Deeper personality expression
- More sophisticated capabilities
- Better collaboration skills

## Cross-Specialization

While each Digimon has one primary specialization, they can:
- Develop basic skills in related areas
- Collaborate effectively with other specializations
- Understand adjacent domains at surface level
- Contribute general capabilities to any task

This enables flexible collaboration while maintaining distinct identities.
